# BlackIce

The concept for the project was to create a data tracker and data display for a researcher who took carbon samples from ice in mountain ranges around the world - hence "Black Ice".  The project allows the user to visualize the data accumulated over time via automatically generated graphs.  This project utilizes Travis Continuous Integration to ensure the integrity of the code for each update.
